My placement story is a bit different from the other stories that you will come across. I began my preparation for the internship session during the two-month semester break. I appeared in the written round of the first 10 companies with a hope to get an intern but due to many flaws in my preparation strategy and luck not favoring me, I wasn’t able to clear even the first round of any company. All these factors combined led me to think that this wasn’t the correct path for me and I should stick to my goal of pursuing higher studies. So for the rest of 3rd year, I never planned to sit for placements and I continued preparing for my respective goal. It was actually around the end of 3rd year, in the month of March, a close friend of mine, Vijay Krishan Pandey advised me to sit for placement as it would act as a confidence booster for me and then finally I made up my mind.
 So now I will tell you how I got placed at PhonePe by preparing wholeheartedly for 2.5 months. My experience during the internship drive made it clear that I needed to work on my coding skills as I was failing to clear the first round of companies. The mistake that I committed during my internship preparation was that I started reading GFG as a theory book whereas I coded a negligible number of questions. Perhaps this strategy might help you to bag an internship or placement but it isn’t a sure-shot way. During my internship session, I wasn’t mentally prepared to face rejection and that led me to quit after sitting for just 10 companies. This might happen with some of you, but please do not break down and keep revising thoroughly whatever you have studied in those two months.
